			<br>One  of her favorite colors is pink.

				<br>She likes beige and other calmer colors.
				<br>We have a smaller age gap (10 years) and spent a lot of time together
				while Jenn was in Boston studying baby teeth, so we're pretty close too :)
				<br>Fun Fact: people always think she's the youngest because she's so teeny (heh) </p>
